# Bright Cloud Studio's Constant Contact Integration
This package connects Contao's Forms to Constant Contact's API. Create a Form and select which List to import data into. Add fields to the form and link them to specific Constant Contact fields. Add a checkbox to make sure the user gives express permission to be added to the contact list.

## Setup Directions

- Step One:
First things first, you will need to establish a connection with Constant Contact. To do this you will need to set up a page specifically for authorizing the connection. On Contao, set up a page for this purpose and copy its unique URL. This will be our Redirect URL.
